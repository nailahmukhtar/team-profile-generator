# Team Profile Generator - Test Driven Development
A profile generator that takes in basic information about a team such as name, email etc. and produces a visual team profile based on that information.

## Description

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to understand how test driven development works in practice, guiding the applications outcome rather than testing as an afterthought. I also implemented the class syntax within this project and now better understand the benefits of these vs. Prototypes.

The task was to create an application that produced a team profile based on user input 

* Once the application is run, the user can answer the prompts and generate a team profile for a software engineering team.
* Uses the inquirer package to prompt user input
* Uses Jest for testing

What I could improve: 
* I could refactor my code to make use of the employee class and re-use the data between types of employee
* I could separate out more of the code into re-usable functions


## Usage
